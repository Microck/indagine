# Logo Prompts for Indagine

**Project Context**: Meta-agent system that debugs other AI agents when they fail. Analyzes trace + tool behavior, classifies root cause using shared taxonomy, proposes diff-first fixes.

**Project Name Origin**: Italian for "investigation" or "inquiry" — evokes detective work, forensic analysis, systematic discovery.

**Suggested Vibe**: Technical, investigative, sophisticated, forensic

## Color Palette

| Role | Color | Hex | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----|-----------|
| Primary | Deep Obsidian | `#1A1F2E` | Dark, serious base — like a detective's notebook, technical precision |
| Secondary | Amber Insight | `#F59E0B` | Warm gold — illumination, the "aha" moment when root cause is found |
| Accent | Electric Teal | `#14B8A6` | Fresh, modern — the fix/solution emerging from investigation |
| Neutral | Slate Whisper | `#64748B` | Balanced gray — supporting technical documentation |

**Palette Story**: A noir-inspired forensic aesthetic. The dark obsidian base represents the unknown failure being investigated. Amber insight cuts through like a detective's lamp, illuminating the problem. Electric teal represents the solution — clean, technical, and actionable.

## Prompt 1: Abstract Geometric — Monocle/Lens
```
abstract geometric logo for indagine, stylized monocle lens shape with circular frame and crosshair detail inside, flat Amber Insight #F59E0B on white, centered, balanced negative space, minimalist modernist --ar 1:1 --stylize 70 --no gradient shadow 3D photo background
```

**Concept**: A simplified monocle/lens shape — investigation, focus, looking deeper. Single amber color for clarity and warmth.

---

## Prompt 2: Two-Color — Magnifying Circuit
```
geometric logo mark for indagine, magnifying glass silhouette where the lens contains abstract circuit traces, two-color Deep Obsidian #1A1F2E and Electric Teal #14B8A6, flat design on white, centered, clean vector style --ar 1:1 --stylize 65 --no gradient shadow 3D photo background
```

**Concept**: Investigation meets technology. The obsidian magnifier frames teal circuit patterns inside — finding issues in agent traces.

---

## Prompt 3: Abstract Mark — Intersection Point
```
abstract logo mark for indagine, two intersecting lines forming an X intersection point with small dot at center, flat Electric Teal #14B8A6 on white, geometric minimalist, centered, represents pinpointing the root cause --ar 1:1 --stylize 75 --no gradient shadow 3D photo background
```

**Concept**: The moment of discovery — pinpointing exactly where things went wrong. Simple X marks the spot with a focal point.

---

## Prompt 4: Wordmark Accent — Investigative Typography
```
wordmark logo for indagine, clean sans-serif typography, letter 'i' styled as a stylized magnifying glass handle, flat Deep Obsidian #1A1F2E with Amber Insight #F59E0B accent on the 'i' dot, centered on white, modern technical --ar 1:1 --stylize 60 --no gradient shadow 3D photo background
```

**Concept**: Text-based mark with personality. The 'i' becomes a magnifying glass, the amber dot as the lens/glow of discovery.

---

## Prompt 5: Abstract — Trace Path
```
abstract geometric logo for indagine, zigzag line path that resolves into straight line, representing trace analysis and debugging, two-color Deep Obsidian #1A1F2E and Electric Teal #14B8A6, flat on white, centered, represents journey from chaos to clarity --ar 1:1 --stylize 70 --no gradient shadow 3D photo background
```

**Concept**: Visualizes the debugging process — chaotic traces becoming clean, resolved. The teal shows the fix emerging.

---

## Prompt 6: Minimal — Investigation Eye
```
minimal logo mark for indagine, abstract eye shape with circular pupil as a dot, flat Slate Whisper #64748B with Electric Teal #14B8A6 pupil accent on white, centered, represents observation and detection, clean geometric --ar 1:1 --stylize 65 --no gradient shadow 3D photo background
```

**Concept**: Observation, detection, watching for failures. The teal pupil accent adds energy and modernity to the clinical gray.

---

## Prompt 7: Compound Mark — Root Node
```
abstract logo mark for indagine, tree root system simplified to geometric lines with one node highlighted, flat Amber Insight #F59E0B highlighted node on Deep Obsidian #1A1F2E root lines, white background, centered, represents root cause analysis --ar 1:1 --stylize 70 --no gradient shadow 3D photo background
```

**Concept**: Root cause made literal. A simplified root/tree structure with the problematic node illuminated in amber — the investigation's target.

## Usage Notes

- **Primary applications**: GitHub repo, documentation, CLI tool branding
- **Recommended style**: Flat, vector, works at small sizes (favicon, terminal)
- **Avoid**: Gradients, shadows, 3D effects, photorealism
- **File formats**: Generate SVG for scalability, PNG for web/favicon
- **Filename convention**: `indagine-logo-[style]-[version].svg`

**After generation**:
1. Select the strongest 2-3 concepts
2. Vectorize using Illustrator, Figma, or vectorizer.ai
3. Test at multiple sizes (favicon 16px → app icon 1024px)
4. Verify works in single color (black/white)
