# Submission Checklist (DEMO-03/04)

Note: The hackathon portal typically accepts an uploaded/hosted demo video link. Committing `demo/video.mp4` to git is optional; you can keep it local and upload/link it during submission.

## Artifact Links

- [ ] README: `README.md`
- [ ] Architecture diagram (preferred): `docs/architecture.png`
- [ ] Architecture diagram source/fallback: `docs/architecture.mmd`
- [ ] Failure taxonomy: `docs/failure_taxonomy.md`
- [ ] Recording checklist: `demo/recording_checklist.md`

## Final Submission Requirements

- [ ] Demo video recorded and uploaded/linked in the portal (target: MP4, about 2 minutes).
- [ ] Optional local copy kept at `demo/video.mp4` (do not commit if you prefer).
- [ ] Demo video clearly shows: failure detection -> analyzer findings -> diagnosis -> fix diff.

- [ ] Architecture artifact is available (`docs/architecture.png`), or fallback render path from `docs/architecture.mmd` is documented.
- [ ] Failure taxonomy document is complete and linked from README.
- [ ] Demo script exists and matches recorded flow: `demo/scenario.md`.

## Submission Form Readiness
