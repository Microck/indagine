# Requirements

## v1 Requirements

### Foundation (FOUND)

- [x] **FOUND-01**: Foundry project initialized with tracing enabled
- [x] **FOUND-02**: BookingAgent that can fail on date format parsing
- [x] **FOUND-03**: SearchAgent that can fail on wrong tool selection
- [x] **FOUND-04**: SummaryAgent that can hallucinate information
- [x] **FOUND-05**: Failure Detector that watches for exceptions, validation failures, timeouts
- [x] **FOUND-06**: Trace capture stores execution traces to Cosmos DB *(implementation complete; live Cosmos run pending credentials)*

### Analysis (ANLZ)

- [ ] **ANLZ-01**: Trace Analyzer parses execution traces and identifies failure step
- [ ] **ANLZ-02**: Trace Analyzer extracts reasoning chain that led to failure
- [ ] **ANLZ-03**: Tool Analyzer validates parameters against tool schema
- [ ] **ANLZ-04**: Tool Analyzer detects wrong tool selection
- [ ] **ANLZ-05**: Autopsy Controller orchestrates Trace and Tool analyzers
- [ ] **ANLZ-06**: Autopsy Controller collects findings into structured output

### Diagnosis (DIAG)

- [ ] **DIAG-01**: Diagnosis Engine implements 6-type failure taxonomy
- [ ] **DIAG-02**: Diagnosis Engine identifies root cause from analyzer findings
- [ ] **DIAG-03**: Diagnosis Engine provides explanation of what went wrong
- [ ] **DIAG-04**: Diagnosis Engine links to similar past failures (if any)

### Fixes (FIX)

- [ ] **FIX-01**: Fix Generator proposes PROMPT_FIX changes (add instructions/examples)
- [ ] **FIX-02**: Fix Generator proposes TOOL_CONFIG_FIX changes (add validation/transformation)
- [ ] **FIX-03**: Fix Generator proposes GUARDRAIL_FIX changes (add output validation/retry)
- [ ] **FIX-04**: Fix Generator shows exact diff of proposed changes

### Demo (DEMO)

- [ ] **DEMO-01**: Scripted demo scenario with BookingAgent date format failure
- [ ] **DEMO-02**: 2-minute video showing: failure → analysis → diagnosis → fix suggestion
- [ ] **DEMO-03**: README with project overview, architecture, and setup instructions
- [ ] **DEMO-04**: Architecture diagram showing all 8 agents and data flow

## v2 Requirements

### Analysis Enhancements

- [ ] Prompt Analyzer checks for ambiguous instructions
- [ ] Prompt Analyzer detects missing context in prompts
- [ ] Parallel execution of all 3 analyzers

### Diagnosis Enhancements

- [ ] Confidence scoring for diagnosis (0-100%)
- [ ] Multiple root cause candidates ranked by likelihood

### Validation

- [ ] Validation Loop re-runs failed scenario with fix applied
- [ ] Trace comparison shows before/after differences
- [ ] Automatic rollback if fix doesn't resolve failure

### Storage

- [ ] Fix history stored for RAG lookup
- [ ] Azure AI Search index over past fixes

## Out of Scope

- **Production deployment** — hackathon demo only, no hardening
- **Self-healing without approval** — fixes require human confirmation
- **Real-time dashboard** — focus on core diagnosis flow
- **Non-Foundry tracing** — tight Azure integration only
- **Code-level bug fixing** — agent debugging, not code repair
- **Copilot Agent Mode integration** — adds complexity without demo value
