<objective>
Finalize submission checklists so Phase 4 can be fully automated.

Purpose: Convert the remaining manual work (video recording + portal submission) into clearly documented, non-blocking checklists so `/gsd-execute-phase 4` can run without pausing for human prompts.
Output: Updated `demo/submission_checklist.md` that treats the demo video as an external artifact upload/link, and a plan summary that records the manual steps as out-of-band.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Make submission checklist explicitly non-blocking for video</name>
  <files>demo/submission_checklist.md</files>
  <action>
Update `demo/submission_checklist.md` so the demo video is treated as a manual external artifact:
- Judges typically want a video link/upload on the portal; committing `demo/video.mp4` is optional.
- Keep the checklist items, but phrase them as "recorded and uploaded/linked" with an optional local file path.
  </action>
  <verify>rg -n "uploaded|linked|portal" demo/submission_checklist.md && rg -n "demo/video\\.mp4" demo/submission_checklist.md</verify>
  <done>Submission checklist documents external video upload/linking and no longer implies that committing `demo/video.mp4` is required.</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
- `demo/submission_checklist.md` documents video recording and portal upload as manual steps.

<success_criteria>
Phase 4 is automation-complete: the remaining manual work is documented clearly, and running `/gsd-execute-phase 4` does not pause for interactive checkpoints.
</success_criteria>
