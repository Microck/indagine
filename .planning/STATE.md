## Phase 1 Requirement Snapshot

| REQ-ID | Requirement | Status | Notes |
|--------|-------------|--------|-------|
| FOUND-01 | Foundry project initialized with tracing enabled | Completed | Strict verification path implemented and approved |
| FOUND-02 | BookingAgent that can fail on date format parsing | Completed | Deterministic DD/MM/YYYY schema-validation failure added with CLI + tests |
| FOUND-03 | SearchAgent that can fail on wrong tool selection | Completed | Ambiguous instruction now deterministically fails tool validation |
| FOUND-04 | SummaryAgent that can hallucinate information | Completed | Reproducible hallucinated output with explicit false claim marker |
| FOUND-05 | Failure Detector that watches for exceptions, validation failures, timeouts | Completed | Structured FailureEvent + TraceRecord emitted for booking/search/summary scenarios |
| FOUND-06 | Trace capture stores execution traces to Cosmos DB | Completed | Implementation approved; live Cosmos verification remains pending credentials |

## Decisions

| Phase | Decision | Rationale |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| 01-01 | Canonicalized direct runtime config to `FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT` + `FOUNDRY_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT` with YAML fallback | Keeps a single predictable env surface and avoids alias drift |
| 01-01 | Added `--strict` mode to `verify_foundry` while keeping default local-friendly behavior | Enables deterministic local scaffolding checks without blocking strict CI/live validation |
| 01-02 | Subject scenario functions fail deterministically via shared `ToolValidationError` contract | Keeps failure assertions stable for tests and future analyzers |
| 01-02 | Runner reports `failed`/`hallucinated` in JSON while always exiting 0 | Allows deterministic batch execution without shell-level flakiness |
| 01-03 | Pinned `TraceRecord` contract to `schema_version=1` with `extra="forbid"` | Prevents silent schema drift before analyzers depend on trace payload shape |
| 01-03 | Defaulted TraceStore to memory fallback and keyed persistence by `failure_id` | Keeps local end-to-end runs unblocked while preserving direct retrieval semantics |

---

## Blockers/Concerns Carried Forward

- Live Cosmos verification still requires user-provided `COSMOS_ENDPOINT`, `COSMOS_KEY`, `COSMOS_DATABASE`, and `COSMOS_CONTAINER_TRACES`.
- System Python in this environment lacks required runtime modules; use `.venv/bin/python -m ...` for deterministic plan verification.
